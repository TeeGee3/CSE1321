Lab4A: I hate Mondays
To start off, you’re going to write a program that prompts the user for a day of the week. For
Monday, Wednesday and Friday the program responds with a special message. For all other
input, the program should print a standard message of “It’s another day of the week”. The program
should behave like the sample runs below. The class name should be Lab4A…
Sample run #1:
  Enter the day: Monday
  Sounds like someone has a case of the Mondays!
Sample run #2:
  Enter the day: Wednesday
  It's hump day! El ombligo!
  Sample run #3:
  Enter the day: Friday
  Finally. It's Friday!
  Sample run #4:
  Enter the day: Tuesday
  It's another day of the week.


Lab4B: Takin’ Care of Business
The weekly pay for an employee is determined based on the following parameters:
Standard work hours by week is 40 hours.
Hourly pay rate is $15.00 per hour.
Overtime hours are paid an additional $10.00 per hour (that is $25.00 per hour).
For this part of the lab, you should write a program that takes in the number of hours worked per
week (as an integer value) and then prints out the gross earning based on the chart above. Your
program should behave like the sample runs below.
Sample run #1:
  Number of hours this week: 35
  Earnings: $525
  Sample run #2:
  Number of hours this week: 45
  Earnings: $725
  Sample run #3:
  Number of hours this week: 60
  Earnings: $1100


Lab4C: Just a moment!
Switch statements are often used to as a mechanism to route messages in systems.
For example, you may present the user with a menu of options (e.g. “Press 1 for movie times,
Press 2 for features”). Once the user presses a button, the system then “switches” on that input
and runs a set of code to handle their choice.
For this part of the lab, you’re going to build a system that presents the user with three (3) choices.
Depending on the user input, the program will display output that should look like the sample
output below. The program should gracefully handle input values less than 1 and greater than 3
(see Sample run #4).

Sample run #1:
  Select from the following:
  To see a list of movies, press 1.
  To see show times, press 2.
  To pay your bill, press 3.
  Choice: 1
  The Neverending Story 6
  Princess Diaries: the untold story
  Monty Python and the Programmer
Sample run #2:
  Select from the following:
  To see a list of movies, press 1.
  To see show times, press 2.
  To pay your bill, press 3.
  Choice: 2
  All movies play at 3PM.
Sample run #3:
  Select from the following:
  To see a list of movies, press 1.
  To see show times, press 2.
  To pay your bill, press 3.
  Choice: 3
  Corporate accounts payable, Nina speaking.
  Just a moment!
Sample run #4:
  Select from the following:
  To see a list of movies, press 1.
  To see show times, press 2.
  To pay your bill, press 3.
  Choice: 7
  I'm sorry, Dave. I can't do that.


Lab4D: Water company (Extra Credit +10pts)
Imagine a water company that bases their rates on how much water a household uses. The more
water that the household uses, the higher your rate per gallon will be. For households that use
less than 1,000 gallons per month, they are charged $0.15 per gallon. If a household uses more
than 1,000 gallons, the water beyond the 1,000 gallons is charged at $0.25 per gallon up to 2,000
gallons. The water usage that exceeds 2,000 gallons is charged at $0.35. Write a program that
asks the user to input how many gallons they used for the month and then calculates their water
bill.
As an example, if a person uses 1,200 gallons, 200 of those gallons will be at the rate of $0.25 and
the remaining 1,000 will be at the rate of $0.15.
Note: the logic flow of this program is unusual, but interesting. Can you solve it?

Sample run #1:
  Gallons of water: 1000
  Water bill is: $150.0
  Sample run #2:
  Gallons of water: 1500
  Water bill is: $275.0
  Sample run #3:
  Gallons of water: 2750
  Water bill is: $662.5
