Lab3A: Credit Cards. Financial advisors will almost always tell you that you should pay for things
in cash and avoid credit card debt. Further, they tell you that you should have a small emergency
fund that you keep stocked for emergencies like flat tires, dead refrigerators and so on. However,
life doesn’t always work that way and sometimes we need to charge things. So, for this part of the
lab, we’re going to write a calculator that calculates your minimum monthly payment on your card.
To do that, you’ll ask the user for 1) the amount of money they have on their credit card and 2) the
“APR” – or Annual Percentage Rate – of the card. We’ll keep the calculations simple (so these
aren’t perfect), but to calculate the minimum payment, you multiply the amount you owe times
APR/12 – since there are 12 months in a year. Note: paying just the minimum should be a last
resort, since it usually does not make progress towards paying off the card. Note: the $ below is
part of the prompt, not what the user enters. Your program should behave User input is in bold.

Sample run 1:
    Amount owed: $2000
    APR: 19.75
    Monthly percentage rate: 1.64583
    Minimum payment: $32.9167
    Sample run 2:
    Amount owed: $8500
    APR: 29
    Monthly percentage rate: 2.41667
    Minimum payment: $205.417



Lab3B: GPA calculator. Yes! Another calculator! GPA is important. Not only do you need to
have a 2.0 GPA to graduate from KSU, it’s also one of the many things that employers look in the
interview process. If you don’t know how that’s calculated, you need to understand that it’s based
on “quality points” using the following scale:
• A = 4 quality points
• B = 3 quality points
• C = 2 quality points
• D = 1 quality point
• F = 0 quality points
Second, each course counts for a certain number of hours. For example, most courses are 3
hours. This lab is a 1-hour course. If you take Calculus, that’s 4 hours. To calculate the quality
points that you earn for just one course, multiply the number of hours of that course * the quality
points you earn for that course.
To calculate your GPA for an entire semester, you take the total number of quality points earned
that semester and divide through by the total number of hours taken that semester.
For this part of the lab, write a program that asks for the number of hours and quality points earned
for four courses, then displays the total hours, total quality points, and GPA. For this part of the
lab, you should only use floats as the data type for your variables. User input is in bold.

Sample run 1:
    Course 1 hours: 4
    Grade for course 1: 4
    Course 2 hours: 3
    Grade for course 2: 3
    Course 3 hours: 3
    Grade for course 3: 4
    Course 4 hours: 4
    Grade for course 4: 4
    Total hours is: 14
    Total quality points is: 53
    Your GPA for this semester is 3.78571
Sample run 2:
    Course 1 hours: 4
    Grade for course 1: 1
    Course 2 hours: 1
    Grade for course 2: 4
    Course 3 hours: 3
    Grade for course 3: 4
    Course 4 hours: 3
    Grade for course 4: 3
    Total hours is: 11
    Total quality points is: 29
    Your GPA for this semester is 2.63636


Lab3C: Design and implement a program that determines the values of coins in a jar. The program
prints out the total dollars and cents in the jar. The program prompts the user to enter the number
of coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies). Print out the number of coins entered for each
coin type on separate lines followed by the total amount of money in the jar as dollars and cents as
shown below.

Sample run 1:
    Enter the number of quarters: 2
    Enter the number of dimes: 2
    Enter the number of nickels: 2
    Enter the number of pennies: 2
    You entered 2 quarters.
    You entered 2 dimes.
    You entered 2 nickels.
    You entered 2 pennies.
    Your total is 0 dollars and 82 cents.
Sample run 3:
    Enter the number of quarters: 2
    Enter the number of dimes: 3
    Enter the number of nickels: 4
    Enter the number of pennies: 5
    You entered 2 quarters.
    You entered 3 dimes.
    You entered 4 nickels.
    You entered 5 pennies.
    Your total is 1 dollars and 5 cents.
