Lab6A (Warmup): One of my favorite programs is the “Gimme a cookie” program. In years past,
students would have to log into a main terminal to do their labs. Periodically, a student would
leave their terminal for a few minutes and someone else would write a program that would prompt
the user with “Gimme a cookie”. It would surprise people when they returned to their terminal to
see “Gimme a cookie”. They would enter random things until they figured out they just had to type
the word “cookie” to regain control of their terminal. For this lab, you’ll write this program using a
do-while loop. Using a for or while loop to solve this problem will receive no credit. User input is
denoted in bold. Hint: don’t forget how to compare strings…
  Sample output:
    Gimme a cookie: who is this?
    Gimme a cookie: I'm not joking
    Gimme a cookie: What is going on?
    Gimme a cookie: help
    Gimme a cookie: cookie
  
  
Lab6B: Min/Max: For this lab, you’re going to use a while loop. Write a program that asks the
user for a number between -1000 and +1000 (an integer) until they type in 0. After each number is
entered, the program will print out the maximum and minimum number entered so far. For
simplicity, initialize your minimum to be the value 1001 and your maximum to be -1001. Here’s a
puzzle for advanced students: If you wanted to code this to work regardless of the range, how
would you do it? You could use things like Math.MIN and Math.MAX, but is there another way?
  Sample output:
    Enter a number between -1000 and +1000: 6
    Min is 6
    Max is 6
    Enter a number between -1000 and +1000: 11
    Min is 6
    Max is 11
    Enter a number between -1000 and +1000: -3
    Min is -3
    Max is 11
    Enter a number between -1000 and +1000: 99
    Min is -3
    Max is 99
    Enter a number between -1000 and +1000: -45
    Min is -45
    Max is 99
    Enter a number between -1000 and +1000: 3
    Min is -45
    Max is 99
    Enter a number between -1000 and +1000: 0
    Min is -45
    Max is 99

Lab6C: Well, that’s an odd question! For the last part of this lab, you’re going to use a for loop.
Write a program that asks the user for a starting number and ending number to count between;
assume both numbers will be positive numbers. The program should then sum up all of the odd
numbers. The program must work even if the starting number is larger than the ending number.
Hint: compare a loop that counts “up” and a loop that counts “down”. What’s different? Start by
getting sample output #1 and #2 working, then work on #3.
  Sample output #1:
    Enter a starting number: 3
    Enter an ending number: 7
    Sum of odds is: 15
  Sample output #2:
    Enter a starting number: 10
    Enter an ending number: 20
    Sum of odds is: 75
  Sample output #3:
    Enter a starting number: 20
    Enter an ending number: 10
    Sum of odds is: 75
