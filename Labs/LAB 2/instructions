Lab2A: MadLibs. Several years ago, parents would buy their kids a copy of MadLibs before going
on a long car trip. Basically, one person would ask another to provide a name, an adverb, an
adjective, a number, and so on. The responses would then get plugged into a pre-written script,
and the results would be bizarrely funny. For this assignment, weâ€™re going to code a short version
of that. Your program should behave like the following code. User input is denoted in bold. Both
the class and filename should be called Lab2A (.java, .cs, .cpp).

Sample run:
Enter a name: Tiffany
Enter another name: Bubba
Enter a verb: eat
Enter an adverb: wickedly
Once upon a time, there was a person named Tiffany who had a child named
Bubba. This child would eat wickedly while singing to strangers.



Lab2B: Design and implement a program to print out the following shape using stars (SHIFT-8)
and underscores (SHIFT-minus). Both the class and filename should be called Lab2B (.java, .cs,
.cpp).
Sample run:
___*___
__*_*__
_*_*_*_
*_*_*_*
_*_*_*_
__*_*__
___*___



Lab2C: Design and implement a program that will read in a width and height from the user and
then calculate and display the area and perimeter of a rectangle. Format the outputs following this
sample run. User input is in bold. Both the class and filename should be called Lab2C (.java, .cs,
.cpp).

Sample run:
Enter a width: 4
Enter a height: 8
The area is 32
The perimeter is 24
