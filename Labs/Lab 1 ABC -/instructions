Three programs have three problems with them:
• One of the programs below has a logic error in it – meaning that, while it compiles and runs, it
doesn’t produce the correct output. You must find the error and fix it.
• One of the programs below doesn’t compile, so you can’t even run it! Based on what we just told
you, you must figure out why, fix the error, save the file, and re-run the code.
• One of the programs compiles and runs fine – but has a typo in the output. If you were to submit
this file, the autograder won’t like it (because the output does not match). You may try submitting
the lab before fixing the error so you can see what the autograder does.
When creating the files for the programs below, they must be called Lab1A, Lab1B, and Lab1C (and have
the appropriate .java, .cs or .cpp file extension).
Fix, compile and run the programs below, then submit them in Gradescope.

================================== Program Lab1A.java ===================================
// Program Lab1A
// Demonstrate the difference between print and println.
public class Lab1A
{
 // Prints two lines of output representing a rocket countdown.
 public static void main (String[] args)
 {
 System.out.print ("Three... ");
 System.out.print ("Two... ");
 System.out.print ("One... ")
 System.out.print ("Zero... ");
 System.out.println ("Liftoff!"); // appears on first line
 System.out.println ("Houston, we have a problem.");
 }
}


==================================== Program Lab1B.java ======================================
// Program Lab1B.java
// Demonstrate reading a string from the user.
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Lab1B
{
 // Reads a character string from the user and prints it.
 public static void main (String[] args)
 {
 String message;
 Scanner scan = new Scanner (System.in);
 System.out.print ("Enter a line of text:");
 message = scan.nextLine();
 System.out.println ("You entred: \"" + message + "\"");
 }
}

=================================== Program Lab1C.java =================================
// Program Lab1C.java
// Demonstrate the use of the Scanner class to read numeric data.
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Lab1C
{
 // Calculates fuel efficiency based on values entered by the user.
 public static void main (String[] args)
 {
 int miles;
 double gallons, mpg;
 Scanner scan = new Scanner (System.in);
 System.out.print ("Enter the number of miles: ");
 miles = scan.nextInt();

 System.out.print ("Enter the gallons of fuel used: ");
 gallons = scan.nextDouble();

 mpg = miles * gallons;
 System.out.println ("Miles Per Gallon: " + mpg);
 }
}
