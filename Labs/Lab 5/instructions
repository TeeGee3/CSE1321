Lab5A: To isolate or not isolate. That is the question.
We hope you’re doing well this semester and, most importantly, staying healthy! Along those lines,
if you haven’t seen it before, you can take a COVID-19 Self-Assessment test on KSU’s website at
https://coronavirus.kennesaw.edu/ . For this part of the lab, you’re going to write a program that
mimics the logic of the self-assessment. Before starting this, you’ll need to go through the selfassessment multiple times trying all the possibilities.
Write a program that prompts the user with questions, reads input from them (as characters), and
provides an assessment based on the input. The program should behave like the sample output
below. As always, user input is indicated by bold characters.
Note: KSU has a helpline that can help answer your COVID-related questions: 470-578-6644

Sample output #1:
  Experiencing severe symptoms (Y/N)? Y
  Seek emergency care.
Sample output #2:
  Experiencing severe symptoms (Y/N)? N
  Close contact with someone who has COVID (Y/N)? Y
  Quarantine and get tested if you feel sick.
Sample output #3:
  Experiencing severe symptoms (Y/N)? N
  Close contact with someone who has COVID (Y/N)? N
  If you experience other symptoms, isolate and get tested.
  
 
Lab5B: Sounds like somebody has a case of the Mondays
For this part of the lab, you’re going to design and implement a program to determine the day of
your next meeting based on today. The program reads an integer from the user that represents
today’s day (assume 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, 3 for Wednesday, etc…). You’ll
then prompt the user for another integer value representing the number of days until the meeting.
The program determines and prints out the meeting day. The program should behave like the
sample output below.
Note: You must use a switch statement as part of your solution.
Sample output #1:
  Enter a number that represents today (Sunday==0, Monday==1,...) 2
  Enter the number of days until the meeting: 21
  Meeting day is Tuesday
Sample output #2:
  Enter a number that represents today (Sunday==0, Monday==1,...) 0
  Enter the number of days until the meeting: 11
  Meeting day is Thursday
Sample output #3:
  Enter a number that represents today (Sunday==0, Monday==1,...) 5
  Enter the number of days until the meeting: 3523
  Meeting day is Sunday
  
  
Lab5C: What’s the point?
For the last part of your lab, design and implement a program that prompts the user to enter the xcoordinate and y-coordinate of a point (in a Cartesian plane) as integer values. The program prints
out the entered values followed by the location of the point on the plane. The possibilities for a
point are: the origin, on the x-axis, on the y-axis, in the first quadrant, in the second quadrant, in
the third quadrant, or in the fourth quadrant. Format the outputs following the sample runs below.
Sample output #1:
  Enter x: 0
  Enter y: 0
  This point is the origin.
Sample output #2:
  Enter x: 0
  Enter y: 5
  This point is on the y axis.
Sample output #3:
  Enter x: -5
  Enter y: 0
This point is on the x axis.
  Sample output #4:
  Enter x: 1
  Enter y: 1
  This point is in the first quadrant.
Sample output #5:
  Enter x: -1
  Enter y: -1
  This point is in the third quadrant.
